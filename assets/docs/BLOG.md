## Salesforce DX
- Salesforce DX is a Command Line Interface tool based on the Node.js Open CLI Framework (OCLIF) built by Heroku. To extend the features of the CLI tool, we are given the capability to create custom plugins which are Salesforce DX plugins.

### Salesforce DX Plugins
- There are several use cases in which we can use Salesforce DX plugins:
  - File manipulation scripts
  - Automation scripts
  - Source code generators
  - Code clean up scripts
  - Etc

- Plugins are written in TypeScript
  - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
  - Compatible with the latest ECMAScript specification.
